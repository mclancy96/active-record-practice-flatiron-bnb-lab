# ActiveRecord Practice: Flatiron BnB Lab

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- **Active Record Migrations**: Create and modify database tables using Active Record migrations with different data types
- **Active Record Associations**: Establish and manage relationships between models (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- **Class and Instance Methods**: Implement custom methods to manipulate data and perform operations
- **Active Record Querying**: Perform database queries using Active Record methods to filter, sort, and retrieve data efficiently

## Overview

You're going to build a simplified version of Airbnb using ActiveRecord! This lab focuses purely on the data layer - you'll create models, migrations, associations, and custom methods without getting distracted by Rails complexity.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

2. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   rake db:create
   ```

## Part 1: Database Migrations

You need to create migrations for six related models. Think carefully about the relationships between these entities:

- **Users** can be both hosts (who list properties) and guests (who make reservations)
- **Cities** contain multiple neighborhoods
- **Neighborhoods** belong to cities and contain multiple listings
- **Listings** belong to neighborhoods and are hosted by users
- **Reservations** connect guests (users) to listings
- **Reviews** are written by guests about their reservations

### Step 1: Create Migration Files

Create migration files for each model. Use descriptive names that follow Rails conventions:

```bash
rake db:create_migration NAME=create_users
rake db:create_migration NAME=create_cities
rake db:create_migration NAME=create_neighborhoods
rake db:create_migration NAME=create_listings
rake db:create_migration NAME=create_reservations
rake db:create_migration NAME=create_reviews
```

### Step 2: Define Your Schema

Think about what attributes each model needs and their data types:

#### Users Table

- `name` (string) - The user's name
- `email` (string) - User's email address (add unique index)
- `created_at` and `updated_at` (datetime) - Rails timestamps

#### Cities Table

- `name` (string) - The city name
- `state` (string) - State/province abbreviation
- `country` (string) - Country name
- `created_at` and `updated_at` (datetime)

#### Neighborhoods Table

- `name` (string) - The neighborhood name
- `city_id` (integer) - Foreign key to cities table
- `zip_code` (string) - Postal code for the area
- `created_at` and `updated_at` (datetime)

#### Listings Table

- `title` (string) - The listing title
- `description` (text) - Longer description text
- `address` (string) - The street address
- `listing_type` (string) - e.g., "private room", "entire home"
- `price` (decimal, precision: 8, scale: 2) - Price per night
- `max_guests` (integer) - Maximum number of guests
- `neighborhood_id` (integer) - Foreign key to neighborhoods
- `host_id` (integer) - Foreign key to users (the host)
- `active` (boolean, default: true) - Whether listing is currently active
- `created_at` and `updated_at` (datetime)

#### Reservations Table

- `checkin` (date) - Check-in date
- `checkout` (date) - Check-out date
- `guest_count` (integer) - Number of guests
- `status` (string, default: 'confirmed') - Reservation status
- `listing_id` (integer) - Foreign key to listings
- `guest_id` (integer) - Foreign key to users (the guest)
- `created_at` and `updated_at` (datetime)

#### Reviews Table

- `description` (text) - The review text
- `rating` (integer) - Rating from 1-5
- `cleanliness_rating` (integer) - Specific rating for cleanliness (1-5)
- `communication_rating` (integer) - Host communication rating (1-5)
- `guest_id` (integer) - Foreign key to users (who wrote the review)
- `reservation_id` (integer) - Foreign key to reservations
- `created_at` and `updated_at` (datetime)

### Step 3: Run Your Migrations

```bash
rake db:migrate
```

**Tip**: If you make a mistake, you can rollback and fix it:

```bash
rake db:rollback
# Edit your migration file
rake db:migrate
```

## Part 2: Model Associations

Now implement the ActiveRecord associations in your model files. Consider these relationships:

### User Model (`app/models/user.rb`)

A user can be both a host and a guest:

- As a host: has many listings
- As a host: has many reservations through their listings
- As a guest: has many reservations (called "trips")
- As a guest: has many reviews

### City Model (`app/models/city.rb`)

- Has many neighborhoods
- Has many listings through neighborhoods

### Neighborhood Model (`app/models/neighborhood.rb`)

- Belongs to a city
- Has many listings

### Listing Model (`app/models/listing.rb`)

- Belongs to a neighborhood
- Belongs to a host (user)
- Has many reservations
- Has many reviews through reservations
- Has many guests through reservations

### Reservation Model (`app/models/reservation.rb`)

- Belongs to a listing
- Belongs to a guest (user)
- Has many reviews

### Review Model (`app/models/review.rb`)

- Belongs to a guest (user)
- Belongs to a reservation

**Key Challenge**: Notice how `User` has multiple relationships - they can be both hosts and guests. You'll need to use `class_name` and `foreign_key` options for some associations.

## Part 3: Seed Your Database

Once you've created your models and associations, populate your database with the comprehensive seed data:

```bash
rake db:seed
```

This will create a rich dataset including:

- **4 cities** (NYC, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago)
- **9 neighborhoods** across those cities
- **6 users** who act as both hosts and guests
- **8 listings** with different types and price ranges
- **9 reservations** spanning past, present, and future dates
- **6 reviews** with varying ratings

The seed data is designed to help you practice complex queries and understand the relationships between models. You'll have:

- **Prolific hosts** (like Alice with 3 listings)
- **Frequent travelers** (like Charlie with multiple trips)
- **Cross-relationships** (users who are both hosts and guests)
- **Realistic data patterns** for testing your custom methods

### Test Your Associations

After seeding, test your associations in the console:

```bash
rake console
```

Try these example queries to verify your associations work:

```ruby
# Basic associations
User.first.listings                    # Should return listings hosted by the first user
City.find_by(name: "New York City").neighborhoods  # Should return NYC neighborhoods
Listing.first.host                     # Should return the user who hosts this listing

# More complex associations
alice = User.find_by(name: "Alice Johnson")
alice.listings.count                   # Should show Alice's 3 listings
alice.guests                          # Should show all guests who stayed at Alice's places

# Cross-model queries
Listing.joins(:reviews).where('reviews.rating >= 4')  # Highly rated listings
User.joins(:listings).distinct.count  # Count of users who are hosts
```

The comprehensive seed data will give you plenty of material to practice with when implementing your custom methods!

## Part 4: Custom Methods

Now add custom methods to your models that leverage the associations and demonstrate different ActiveRecord concepts:

### User Methods

Add these **instance methods** to the User class:

1. **`#host?`** - Returns true if the user has any listings

## Part 5: Testing Your Work

Run the test suite to check your implementation:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

The tests will verify:

- ✅ Your migrations created the correct tables and columns
- ✅ Your associations work properly
- ✅ Your custom methods return expected results

Use the console to test your methods interactively:

```bash
rake console
```

## Final Tips & Best Practices

### Debugging Checklist

When your method isn't working:

1. **Check the association** - does `user.listings` return what you expect?
2. **Test the SQL** - use `.to_sql` to see what query is being generated
3. **Check for typos** - method names, column names, association names
4. **Verify data exists** - are there records to work with?
5. **Use `binding.pry`** - step through your method line by line
6. **Check the return value** - methods should return what you expect

### Additional Practice Ideas

Once you've completed the basic requirements, try these challenges:

1. **Build a booking system** - prevent double bookings for the same dates
2. **Add price calculations** - include taxes, fees, and discounts
3. **Create a search system** - find listings by multiple criteria
4. **Build analytics** - track popular destinations, peak seasons, etc.
5. **Add user preferences** - favorite listings, saved searches
6. **Implement a rating system** - beyond simple averages
7. **Create reports** - monthly earnings, occupancy rates, etc.


Good luck building your ActiveRecord skills! 🏠✨
